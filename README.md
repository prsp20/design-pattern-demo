## Purpose of creating the project
I created this project while I was taking three courses from Pluralsight on design patterns. Although I was already using many of the design patterns in my working life, I was not familiar with some of them. So I decided to take a detailed course. 

In this project I would like to share the code I created while doing exercise for those courses.
